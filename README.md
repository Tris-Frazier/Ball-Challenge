# Ball-Challenge
MIT xPRO Full Stack Development Bootcamp Challenge

Week 2 Ball Simulation Challenge:

Create a ball using <div> in a html file, make the ball bounce back and forth between edges that you create, and make the balls change when they reach each edge.
  
I created 8 balls, 4 travel along the x-axis and 4 travel along the y-axis.  Each ball is labeled by name and describe the changes they make upon reaching the edge.

Changes are made to the z-index, color, border-radius, height or width.
